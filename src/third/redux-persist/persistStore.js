            //     fired. There wasn't anything interesting there that
            //     was merged with `REHYDRATE`'s payload. And,
            //
            // (b) The `REHYDRATE` payload itself came straight (via
            //     our reviver) from what was saved to storage. It
            //     would only have changed if at least one migration
            //     had run, and it hasn't. In this conditional, we
            //     know that it hasn't because the previous version
            //     (in redux-persist-migrate's terms) is the same as
            //     the current version.
            //
            // Part of the work for preventing the save is already
            // done: `.pause()` is called on `persistor` above, and
            // `.resume()` is called after. This does mean that
            // persisting `REHYDRATE`'s payload isn't triggered
            // directly on `REHYDRATE`. However, it is triggered on a
            // *subsequent* action, because, upon each action, the
            // persistor compares a piece of `lastState` to the
            // corresponding piece of `state` to check whether that
            // piece needs to be persisted -- and, on an action just
            // after `REHYDRATE`, `lastState` is stale, containing the
            // pre-`REHYDRATE` state. That's because `lastState`
            // doesn't naturally update when the persistor is paused.
            //
            // So, fix that by still resetting `lastState` with the
            // result of `REHYDRATE` when the persistor is paused; we
            // can do that because we've exposed `_resetLastWrittenState` on
